## Welcome in 👋

My name is Sophia and I am a undergraduate senior getting ready to graduate with a BS in Psychology and a minor in data analytics 👩‍🎓. I want to eventually pursue a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology but recognize that I need to gain more research experience before I jump into that. I am interested in exploring the relationships between ASD and eating disorders. Thank you for reading.
